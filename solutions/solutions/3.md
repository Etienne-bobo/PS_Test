For each bakery, there are 7 possible choices. Thus, one has $7^{4}=2401$ different ways to assign a weekly closing day to each bakery. 
The only thing one wants to avoid is the case where all bakeries close on the same day. This is only possible if they all close on Monday, or Tuesday or on any other day of the week. It gives only 7 possibilities that such a situation occurs. Hence, the number of possibilities such that every day, there is, at least, one opened bakery equals $7^{4}-7=2401-7=2394$.
