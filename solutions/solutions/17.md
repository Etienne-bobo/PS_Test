5. Let's start by counting the numbers of hands which contains 3 cards with the same value, and which is not a four of a kind. We have 13 choices for the hight, $\binom{4}{3}=4$ choices of 3 color among 4 for this hight. Then, for the two other cards, one has to choose two cards among 48 (one has to exclude the last card with the same hight, otherwise we would have four of a kind), i.e. $\binom{48}{2}=48 \times 47 / 2=1128$ choices. Therefore, there are $13 \times 4 \times 1128=58656$ hands that contain exactly 3 cards with the same hight. In order to determine the number of three of the same kind that exist, one has to remove the full houses. Hence, there are $58656-3744=54912$ three of a kind.
