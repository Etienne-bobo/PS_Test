The first bakery can close any day of the week. The second bakery can only close one of the remaining 6 days. The third can, then, only close one of the remaining 5 days. Finally, the last bakery can close one of the remaining 4 days. Hence, the number of possibilities equals $7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4=840$.
