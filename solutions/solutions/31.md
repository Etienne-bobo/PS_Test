There can be $0,1, \ldots, 9$ books placed before the mathematics books. Therefore, there are 10 choices for the number of books placed before the mathematics books. Once this choice is made, there are 4 ! ways to arrange the mathematics books, and 9 ! ways to arrange the others: so there are a total of $10 \times 4$ !9! different arrangements.
