Denote $W_{i}$ the event: "the U.S wins its $i^{\text {th }}$ game" and $\overline{W_{i}}$ the complement event. According to the wordings we know that:

$$
\mathbf{P}\left(W_{1}\right)=1 / 4, \quad \mathbf{P}\left(W_{1} \mid W_{2}\right)=1 / 2, \quad \mathbf{P}\left(W_{2} \mid \overline{W_{1}}\right)=1 / 10
$$

One can write:

$$
\mathbf{P}\left(W_{1} \mid W_{2}\right)=\frac{\mathbf{P}\left(W_{2} \cap W_{1}\right)}{\mathbf{P}\left(W_{2}\right)}=\frac{\mathbf{P}\left(W_{2} \mid W_{1}\right) \cdot \mathbf{P}\left(W_{1}\right)}{\mathbf{P}\left(W_{2}\right)}=\frac{\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{5}}=\frac{5}{8}
$$

Thus, the probability, for the U.S., to win its first game, knowing that it wins its second is

$$
\mathbf{P}\left(W_{1} \mid W_{2}\right)=5 / 8
$$
