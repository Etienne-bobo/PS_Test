3. We first choose the value of the 3 cards that have the same value. There are 13 such choices. We then choose these 3 cards, with the same value. It makes $\binom{4}{3}=4$ possible choices. We then choose the hight of the other cards. Only 12 choices remains for this step. Then we choose these two cards, with same value. There are $\binom{4}{2}=6$ choices. Finally, the number of hands with a full house is $13 \times 4 \times 12 \times 6=3744$.
