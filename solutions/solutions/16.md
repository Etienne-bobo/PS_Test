4. We first count the number of hands constituted of 5 consecutive cards, wether or not they have the same color. One will then remove the number of straight flush in order to get the number of hands with 5 consecutive cards, that are not with the same color.

If one counts the number hands constituted of 5 consecutive cards, wether or not they have the same color, one must choose the hight of the highest card. As previously, there are 10 possible choices. Then, for each of the five consecutive hight, one chooses one of the 4 colors, which gives 45 choices. Finally, the number of corresponding hands is $10 \times 45=10240$. Thus, the number of straights is $10240-40=10200$.
