Denote $W_{i}$ the event: "the U.S wins its $i^{\text {th }}$ game" and $\overline{W_{i}}$ the complement event. According to the wordings we know that:

$$
\mathbf{P}\left(W_{1}\right)=1 / 4, \quad \mathbf{P}\left(W_{1} \mid W_{2}\right)=1 / 2, \quad \mathbf{P}\left(W_{2} \mid \overline{W_{1}}\right)=1 / 10
$$

It is easy to see that

$$
\mathbf{P}\left(W_{1} \cap \overline{W_{2}}\right)=\mathbf{P}\left(W_{1} \mid \overline{W_{2}}\right) \cdot \mathbf{P}\left(W_{2}\right)=\frac{5}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{5}=\frac{1}{8}
$$

Thus, the probability, for the U.S., to win its two first games is:

$$
\mathbf{P}\left(W_{1} \cap W_{2}\right)=1 / 8
$$
