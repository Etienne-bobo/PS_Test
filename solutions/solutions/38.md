Denote $F_{i}$ : "Get a head at the $i^{\text {th }}$ throw. We have the equality:

$$
A=F_{1} \cap F_{2} \cap F_{3}
$$

It is clear that the outcome of a throw has no impact on the outcome of another throw. In other words the events $F_{1}, F_{2}$ and $F_{3}$ are independent. We hence get:

$$
\mathbf{P}(A)=\mathbf{P}\left(F_{1}\right) \cdot \mathbf{P}\left(F_{2}\right) \cdot \mathbf{P}\left(F_{3}\right)=\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{8}
$$

We hence proved that:

$$
\mathbf{P}(A)=\frac{1}{8}
$$
