Denote $S(n)$ the number of ways there are to walk down the stairs with $n$ stairs. We clearly have $S(1)=1, S(2)=2$ since either we walk down

- one step and then another one
- or two stairs in a row

Besides, $S(3)=4$. Indeed, either we walk down

- one step and then it remains 2 steps (and therefore $S(2)$ ways of doing it)
- or two steps in a row, and then it remains one step to walk down
- or three stairs in a row and we are done

In other words, we have the equality

$$
S(3)=1+1+S(2)=4
$$

Let's now find a recursive formulae to compute $S(n)$ when $n$ is greater or equal to 4 . Our reasoning is based on the first step:

either we walk down a single step: in this case it remains a stair of $n-1$ steps to walk down, and therefore $S(n-1)$ possibilities;

either we walk down a two steps: in this case it remains a stair of $n-2$ steps to walk down, and therefore $S(n-2)$ possibilities;

either we walk down a two steps: in this case it remains a stair of $n-3$ steps to walk down, and therefore $S(n-3)$ possibilities;

We hence have the recursive formulae $S(n)=S(n-1)+S(n-2)+S(n-3)$. We hence have to compute $S(17)$. Several methods are possible. One can use, for example, the following python script:

```
def S(n):
    "Compute recursively the value of S(n)"
    if n<1:
        return 0
    elif n==1:
        return 1
    elif n==2:
        return 2
    elif n==3:
        return 4
    else:
        return S(n-1)+S(n-2)+S(n-3)
```

We hence get $S(17)=19513$.
