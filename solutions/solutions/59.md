By very definition of $X$, one can write:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathbb{P}(X=0)=1 / 10, \mathbb{P}(X=1)=1 / 5, \quad \mathbb{P}(X=2)=3 / 10, \quad \mathbb{P}(X=3)=1 / 4 \\
& \mathbb{P}(X=4)=\frac{3}{20}
\end{aligned}
$$

If we were working on an infinite number of weeks, the average number of tablets one can expect to sell on a given week is between $\mathbb{E}[X]-2 \sigma_{X}$ and $\mathbb{E}[X]+2 \sigma_{X}$. Since $\mathbb{E}[X]-2 \sigma_{X} \approx-\frac{141}{200}$ and $\mathbb{E}[X]+2 \sigma_{X} \approx \frac{1001}{200}$, one can write that:

If we were working on an infinite number of weeks, the average number of tablets one can expect to sell on a given week is between 0 and 5.0.
