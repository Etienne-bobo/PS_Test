The 2022 soccer world cup will take place in Qatar. Let's assume that U.S. will attend to it. In such a competition, the U.S. National team wins its first game with a probability equals to $1 / 4$. Moreover, if it wins its first game then the probability that it also wins its second game is $1 / 2$. However, if it does not succeed in the first game, the probability that it wins its second game decreases to $1 / 10$.

In order to simplify, we will assume that, for each game, there can not be tie game.

What is the probability, for the U.S., to win its first game, knowing that it wins its second?
