1. Compute $\mathbf{P}\left(A^{c}\right), \mathbf{P}\left(A \cap B^{c}\right), \mathbf{P}(A \cup B), \mathbf{P}\left(A \cup B^{c}\right)$ by expressing them as a function of $\mathbf{P}(A), \mathbf{P}(B)$ et $\mathbf{P}(A \cap B)$
2. In this question we assume that $\mathbf{P}(A \cap B)=\mathbf{P}(A) \cdot \mathbf{P}(B)$, in other words that $A$ and $B$ are independent from each other.

Show that $A$ and $B^{c}$ from one hand, and, from an other hand $A^{c}$ and $B^{c}$ are also independent to each other.

3. Let $C$ be another event. Show that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{P}(A \cap B \cap C)=\mathbf{P}(A)+\mathbf{P}(B)+\mathbf{P}(C)-\mathbf{P}(A \cup B)-\mathbf{P}(B \cup C)-\mathbf{P}(C \cup A)+\mathbf{P}(A \cup B \cup C) \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
