We roll a non-rigged die a certain number of times, denoted $N$, and where $N$ is a random variable which belongs to $\mathbf{N}$. Denote $A_{i}$ the event $\{N=i\}$ and assume that:

$$
\mathbf{P}\left(A_{i}\right)=2^{-i}, \forall i \geqslant 1
$$

Denote $S$ the sum of the obtained results (from the first roll and up to the $N^{\text {th }}$ one).

1. Show that $\left(A_{i}\right)_{i \geqslant 1}$ forms a partition of $\Omega$ (you do not have to give it explicitly) and that the following equality holds $\sum_{i \geqslant 1} \mathbf{P}\left(A_{i}\right)=1$.
2. Compute the probability that $S=4$.
3. Compute the probability that $N=2$, knowing that $S=4$.
4. Compute the probability that $S=4$, knowing that $N$ is an even number.
5. Compute the probability that $N=2$, knowing that $S=4$ and that the first die equals 1 .
