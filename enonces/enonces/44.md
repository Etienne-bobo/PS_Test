We roll a non-rigged six sided die infinitely many times. For every $k$ in $\mathbf{N}^{*}$, we consider the following events:

$A_{k}:$ "Getting 6 at the $k^{\text {th }}$ die roll"
$B_{k}$ : "Getting 6, for the first time, at the $k^{\text {th }}$ die roll"

$C_{k}$ : "Never getting a 6 for the first $k$ die roll"

$C_{\infty}$ : "Never getting a 6 at all"

where $k=1,2,3, \ldots$

1. Give a probability space which models this random experiment.
2. To what does the event $\cap_{k \geqslant 1} A_{k}$ correspond to? What is the probability of such an event?
3. Express $B_{n}$ as a function of the events $A_{k}$, for $k \leqslant n$.
4. Compute $\mathbf{P}\left(B_{n}\right)$, and then $\mathbf{P}\left(\cup_{n \geqslant 1} B_{n}\right)$.
5. Compute $\mathbf{P}\left(C_{k}\right)$ and deduce $\mathbf{P}\left(C_{\infty}\right)$. Compare this result to the one of the previous question.
6. (only for math majors)

Using the monotonic limit of events property, compute directly $\mathbf{P}\left(C_{\infty}\right)$.

Hint: For Question 4. one could use (and admit) the following fact:

Let $\left(A_{k}\right)_{1 \leqslant k \leqslant n}$ be a family of independent events. For every integer $i$ in $\llbracket 1, n \rrbracket$, define $\widetilde{A}_{i}=A_{i}$ or $\bar{A}_{i}$. Then, the family $\left(\widetilde{A}_{k}\right)_{1 \leqslant k \leqslant n}$ is constituted with independent events.
