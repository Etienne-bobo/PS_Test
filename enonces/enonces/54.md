Let $X$ be a real-valued random variable.

1. What does mean that the probability distribution of $X$ is a Bernoulli with parameter $p \in[0,1]$ ? Compute its expectation and its variance.
2. Likewise, what does mean that the probability distribution of $X$ is a Binomial with parameters $n$ in $\mathbf{N}^{*}$ and $p$ in $[0,1]$ ? Compute its expectation and its variance.
3. What does mean that the probability distribution of $X$ is uniform on $\left\{x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right\}$ (the $x_{i}$ all being distinct real numbers). Compute its expectation and its variance.
