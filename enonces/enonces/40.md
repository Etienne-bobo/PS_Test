In a building, an alarm system has been installed for the safety at night and during the weekends. The system's alarms can sound without any reason with probability 0.02 .

If there is an attempted break-in, the probability that the system's alarms sounds is $99 \%$. Besides,
the probability that there is an attempted break-in at night is $0.5 \%$

2. If one night, or during a week-end, there is no alert at all, what is the probability that there was an attempted break-in or a real break-in?
