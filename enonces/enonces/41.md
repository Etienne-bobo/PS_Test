We roll two standard six-sided dice. Define the events

- A: "The sum of the two dice equals 7 "
- For $i$ in $\llbracket 1,6 \rrbracket, B_{i}$ :"The second die equals $i$ "

1. Check that the event $A$ is independent from $B_{i}$, for all $i$ in $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$.
2. Is it still true if one replaces 7 by 6 ?
