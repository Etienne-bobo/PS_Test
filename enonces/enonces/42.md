$N$ students, all born in 2000, attend to the same course of Probability. We assume that their birthdays are independent from each others.

1. Model the random experiment which correspond to this problem and show that the probability that two students, at least, have the same birthdate equals

$$
p_{N}:=1-\frac{366!}{(366-N)!366^{N}}, \quad \text { if } N \leqslant 366
$$

2. Determine, numerically, the smallest value of $N$ for which this probability becomes greater than $1 / 2$.
