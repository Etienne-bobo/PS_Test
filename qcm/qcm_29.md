    Question: Determine if the following set is countable:
    ${x \sqrt{|x|}, x \in \mathbf{Q}}$
    Answer Choices:
    a) Yes, it is countable
    b) No, it is uncountable
    c) It is impossible to determine
    d) Only subset A is countable
    Solution: The correct answer is a) Yes, it is countable. The set can be divided into two countable subsets A and B, where A contains all positive values and B contains all negative values. Each subset can be mapped to the set of rational numbers, which is countable. Therefore, the set ${x \sqrt{|x|}, x \in \mathbf{Q}}$ is countable as it is a union of two countable sets.
