Question: In a town, there are four bakeries. Each one of them has to close one day a week. How many different ways are there to assign a weekly closing day to each bakery if every day, there must be at least one bakery open?

Answer Choices:
a) 7^(4-1)=2401
b) 7^(4+1)=16807
c) 7^4-7=2394
d) 7^4+7=2408

Solution: The correct answer is c) 7^4-7=2394. For each bakery, there are 7 possible choices for the closing day, leading to a total of 7^4=2401 different ways to assign a weekly closing day to each bakery. However, we must subtract the 7 possibilities where all bakeries close on the same day, as this does not meet the requirement of having at least one bakery open each day. Therefore, the total number of possibilities is 7^4-7=2394.
