    Question: In a 52-card deck, 5 cards are picked simultaneously. How many different drawings can be obtained containing exactly 2 kings and exactly 3 spades?
    Answer Choices:
    a) 7788
    b) 12
    c) 52
    d) 26
    Solution: The correct answer is a) 7788. To obtain a drawing with exactly 2 kings and exactly 3 spades, we can either choose 2 kings and 3 spades from the remaining cards (non-king and non-spade), which can be done in $\binom{3}{2}$ ways and $\binom{12}{3}$ ways respectively. Or, we can choose the king of spades and two other spades, which can be done in 3 ways and $\binom{12}{2}$ ways respectively, leaving us with 36 choices for the remaining card. This leads to a total of $3\binom{12}{3}+3\binom{12}{2} 36=7788$ possible drawings.
