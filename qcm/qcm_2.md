    Question: In a town, there are four bakeries. Each one of them has to close one day a week, but it is forbidden for two or more bakeries to close on the same day. How many different ways are there to assign a weekly closing day to each bakery?
    Answer Choices:
    a) 7654=840
    b) 4!=24
    c) 4^7=16384
    d) 7^4=2401
    Solution: The correct answer is a) 7654=840. The first bakery can close any day of the week, but the second bakery can only close one of the remaining 6 days. The third bakery can then only close one of the remaining 5 days, and the fourth bakery can only close one of the remaining 4 days. This gives a total of 7654=840 possible combinations.
