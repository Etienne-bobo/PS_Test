    Question: Determine if the following set is countable: $\mathbf{R} \backslash \mathbf{Q}$.
    Answer Choices:
    a) Yes, because it is a finite union of countable sets.
    b) Yes, because it is a subset of $\mathbf{R}$.
    c) No, because $\mathbf{R}$ is not countable.
    d) No, because $\mathbf{N}$ and $\mathbf{Q}$ are not countable.
    Solution: The correct answer is c) No, because $\mathbf{R}$ is not countable. The solution explains that if $\mathbf{R} \backslash \mathbf{Q}$ were countable, then $\mathbf{R}$ would also be countable, which is not true. Therefore, $\mathbf{R} \backslash \mathbf{Q}$ is not countable.
