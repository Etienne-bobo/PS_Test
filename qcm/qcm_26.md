Question: Which of the following sets are countable?
    Answer Choices:
    a) $\mathbf{N}, \mathbf{Z}, \mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{R}$
    b) $\mathbf{Q} \times \mathbf{R}$
    c) $\left\{n^{2}, n \in \mathbf{N}\right\}$
    d) The set of finite sequences of 0 and 1
    e) The set of infinite sequences of 0 and 1
    f) The set of finite sequences of natural numbers
    g) The set of polynomials with one variable and rational coefficients
    h) The set of infinite sequences of natural numbers
    
    Solution: The correct answer is a) $\mathbf{N}, \mathbf{Z}, \mathbf{Q}$ and c) $\left\{n^{2}, n \in \mathbf{N}\right\}$. Option b) $\mathbf{Q} \times \mathbf{R}$ is uncountable, as it can be injected into $\mathbf{R}$ which is uncountable. Option d) The set of finite sequences of
