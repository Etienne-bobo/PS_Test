    Question: How many hands in a standard 52-card deck can contain Four of a Kind?
    Answer Choices:
    a) 52
    b) 624
    c) 13
    d) 48
    Solution: The correct answer is b) 624. There are 13 possible choices for the value of the Four of a Kind (aces, kings, etc.), and once this is chosen, there are 48 possible choices for the remaining card. Thus, there are 13 x 48 = 624 possible hands containing Four of a Kind in a standard 52-card deck.
