    Question: Suppose that $\Omega_{1}$ is a subset of $\Omega$ and $\Omega_{1}$ is not countable. Is it possible for $\Omega$ to be countable?
    Answer Choices:
    a) Yes, it is possible for $\Omega$ to be countable.
    b) No, it is not possible for $\Omega$ to be countable.
    c) It is not possible to determine whether $\Omega$ is countable or not.
    d) It is not possible to determine whether $\Omega$ is countable or not, given the information provided.
    Solution: The correct answer is b) No, it is not possible for $\Omega$ to be countable. According to the contrapositive of the theorem discussed in class, if $\Omega_{1}$ is not countable, then $\Omega$ cannot be countable. Therefore, it is not possible for $\Omega$ to be countable in this scenario.
