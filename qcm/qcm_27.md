    Question: Determine if the following set is countable:
    $\left{n^{2}, n \in \mathbf{N}\right}$
    Answer Choices:
    a) Yes, because $\mathbf{N}$ is countable.
    b) No, because $\mathbf{R}$ is not countable.
    c) Yes, because a subset of a countable set is also countable.
    d) No, because the set is infinite. 
    Solution: The correct answer is c) Yes, because a subset of a countable set is also countable. As $\left{n^{2}, n \in \mathbf{N}\right} \subset \mathbf{N}$, and $\mathbf{N}$ is countable, we can conclude that $\left{n^{2}, n \in \mathbf{N}\right} \subset \mathbf{N}$ is also countable. This is a general rule for subsets of countable sets.
