Question: How many different full house hands can be formed in a game of poker with a standard 52-card deck?

Answer Choices:
a) 156
b) 624
c) 3744
d) 44,224

Solution: The correct answer is c) 3744. To form a full house hand, we first choose the value of the 3 cards with the same value, which can be done in 13 ways. Then we choose these 3 cards, with the same value, from the 4 suits, giving us 4 possible choices. Next, we choose the value of the remaining 2 cards, which can be done in 12 ways. Finally, we choose these 2 cards, with the same value, from the 4 suits, giving us 6 possible choices. Therefore, the total number of full house hands is 13 × 4 × 12 × 6 = 3744.
