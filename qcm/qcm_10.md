    Question: If we simultaneously pick 5 cards from a 52-card deck, how many different drawings can we get that contain at least one king?
    Answer Choices:
    a) 886656
    b) 52
    c) 48
    d) 5
    Solution: The correct answer is a) 886656. To calculate the number of drawings with at least one king, we can first calculate the number of drawings without any kings (the complement). This would be choosing 5 cards from a deck of 48 cards (52-4=48), which can be done in $\binom{48}{5}$ ways. Therefore, the number of drawings with at least one king is equal to the total number of drawings (52 choose 5) minus the number of drawings without any kings, resulting in a total of $\binom{52}{5}-\binom{48}{5}=886656$ possible drawings.
