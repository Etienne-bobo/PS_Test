    Question: In a poker hand consisting of 5 cards, how many three of a kind hands are possible? 
    Answer Choices:
    a) 13
    b) 52
    c) 3744
    d) 54912
    Solution: The correct answer is d) 54912. To determine the number of three of a kind hands, we first calculate the number of hands with 3 cards of the same value (but not a four of a kind), which is 58656. Then, we subtract the number of full houses (3744) from this total, giving us a final count of 54912 three of a kind hands.
