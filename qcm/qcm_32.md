Question: Given that $A$ and $B$ are independent events, which of the following statements is also true?
Answer Choices:
a) $A$ and $B^c$ are independent events.
b) $A^c$ and $B^c$ are independent events.
c) $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive events.
d) $A$ and $B$ have a joint probability of 1.

Solution: The correct answer is b) $A^c$ and $B^c$ are independent events. This can be shown by using the total probability formula and expanding the probabilities using the independence assumption. This leads to the conclusion that $\mathbf{P}(A \cap B \cap C)=\mathbf{P}(A)+\mathbf{P}(B)+\mathbf{P}(C)-\mathbf{P}(A \cup B)-\mathbf{P}(B \cup C)-\mathbf{P}(C \cup A)+\mathbf{P}(A \cup B \cup C)$, which proves that $A$ and $B^c$ are independent events.
