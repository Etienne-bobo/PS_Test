    Question: Is the set of real numbers strictly between 0 and 1 (or, the open interval $]0,1[$) countable? Is the set of real numbers between 0 and 1 countable?
    Answer Choices:
    a) Yes, both sets are countable.
    b) No, neither set is countable.
    c) Yes, the open interval $]0,1[$ is countable but the closed interval $[0,1]$ is not.
    d) No, the open interval $]0,1[$ is not countable but the closed interval $[0,1]$ is. 
    Solution: The correct answer is d) No, the open interval $]0,1[$ is not countable but the closed interval $[0,1]$ is. The solution shows that the function $f:]-1,1\left[\rightarrow \mathbf{R}\right.$ defined by $f(x):=\tan \left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right)$ is a bijection, proving that the set $]-1,1[$ is not countable. As a result, the open interval $]0,1[$, which is a subset of $
