Question: A poker hand is formed by 5 cards, from a 52 play cards game. Usually, Spade, diamond, club and heart are called Colors and the values on the cards are ordered from the smallest to the highest, i.e. $2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10$, Jack, Queen, King, Ace. How many different straight hands can be formed, with 5 consecutive cards and not all of the same color?

Answer Choices:
a) 40
b) 45
c) 10200
d) 10240

Solution: The correct answer is c) 10200. In order to determine the number of straight hands, we first calculate the total number of hands with 5 consecutive cards, regardless of color. This is done by choosing the highest card (10 choices) and then selecting one of the four colors for each of the consecutive cards (45 choices). This results in 10x45=450 possible hands. However, we must subtract the number of straight flush hands (40) in order to get the final count of 10200.
