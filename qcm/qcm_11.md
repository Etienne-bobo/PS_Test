    Question: We pick up, simultaneously, 5 cards from a 52 cards game. How many different drawings can one get containing at most one king?
    Answer Choices:
    a) 52
    b) 48
    c) 2490624
    d) 4
    Solution: The correct answer is c) 2490624. This is calculated by first finding the number of possible drawings without a king, which is given by $\binom{48}{5}$. Then, for drawings with exactly one king, there are 4 ways to choose the king and $\binom{48}{4}$ ways to choose the remaining cards. Therefore, the total number of possible drawings is $\binom{48}{5}+4\binom{48}{4}=2490624$.
