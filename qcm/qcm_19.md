    Question: In a game, $n$ identical dice are rolled. How many distinct rolls are possible? How many ways can we obtain $n$ distinct numbers? How many distinct rolls are possible if the dice are painted in $n$ different colors?
    Answer Choices:
    a) $\binom{n+5}{n}$, $\binom{6}{n}$, $6^n$
    b) $\binom{n+5}{n}$, $6^n$, $A_6^n$
    c) $\binom{n+5}{n}$, $A_6^n$, $\binom{6}{n}$
    d) $6^n$, $\binom{6}{n}$, $A_6^n$
    Solution: The correct answer is a) $\binom{n+5}{n}$, $\binom{6}{n}$, $6^n$. When the dice are indistinguishable, the number of distinct rolls is equivalent to placing $n$ indistinguishable balls into 6 urns, where the number of balls in the $i$-th urn represents the number of repetitions of the value $i, i \in{1, \ldots, 6}$.
