Question: Let $E$ be a finite set with cardinality $p$ and $F$ be a finite set with cardinality $n$. How many different bijections are there from $E$ to $F$?

Answer Choices:
a) $n^p$
b) $A_n^p$
c) $n$
d) $n! \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{(-1)^k}{k!}$
Solution: The correct answer is d) $n! \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{(-1)^k}{k!}$. This can be found by using the formula for the number of bijections without fixed points and taking the limit as $n$ tends to infinity, which converges to $1/e$.
