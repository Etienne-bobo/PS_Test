Question: Let $(\Omega, \mathbf{P})$ be a probability space and let $A$ and $B$ be two events such that $\mathbf{P}(A)=1/3$ and $\mathbf{P}(B)=1/2$. What is the probability of $A\cup B$ in the following cases?
Answer Choices:
a) 1/6
b) 5/6
c) 2/3
d) 7/12
e) 1/4

a) $A$ and $B$ are disjoint
b) $A$ entails $B$
c) $A$ and $B$ are independent
d) $\mathbf{P}(A\mid B)=1/2$

Solution: The correct answers are b) 5/6, c) 2/3, and d) 7/12. In each case, we use the formula $\mathbf{P}(A\cup B)=\mathbf{P}(A)+\mathbf{P}(B)-\mathbf{P}(A\cap B)$ to calculate the probability of $A\cup B$. The values for $\mathbf{P}(
