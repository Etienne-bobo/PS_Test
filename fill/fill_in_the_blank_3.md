    Question: In a town, there are four bakeries. Each one of them has to close one day a week. Complete the following statements to determine the number of ways to assign a weekly closing day to each bakery, while ensuring that there is at least one bakery open every day.
    - For each bakery, there are ________ possible closing days.
    - Therefore, for four bakeries, the total number of possible combinations is ________.
    - The total number of ways to assign a weekly closing day to each bakery, while ensuring at least one bakery is open every day, is ________.
    Solution:
    - For each bakery, there are 7 possible closing days.
    - Therefore, for four bakeries, the total number of possible combinations is 7^4.
    - The total number of ways to assign a weekly closing day to each bakery, while ensuring at least one bakery is open every day, is 7^4 - 7.
