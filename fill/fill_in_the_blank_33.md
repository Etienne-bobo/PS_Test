    Question: Let $(\Omega, \mathbf{P})$ be a probability set, and let $A_{1}, \ldots, A_{n}$ be events such that $\mathbf{P}\left(A_{i}\right)=1, \forall i \in$ ${1, \ldots, n}$. Compute $\mathbf{P}\left(\cap_{i=1}^{n} A_{i}\right)$.
    - For each event $A_{i}$, there is a total of ________ possible outcomes.
    - Therefore, for $n$ events, there is a total of ________ possible combinations.
    - The probability of the intersection of all $n$ events is ________.

    Solution:
    - For each event $A_{i}$, there is a total of 2 possible outcomes.
    - Therefore, for $n$ events, there is a total of 2^n possible combinations.
    - The probability of the intersection of all $n$ events is 1.
