    Question: In a town, there are four bakeries. Each one of them has to close one day a week. Determine the number of ways there are to assign a weekly closing day if no two bakeries can close on the same day.
    - The first bakery can close any day of the week. The second bakery can only close one of the remaining ________ days.
    - The third bakery can only close one of the remaining ________ days.
    - Finally, the last bakery can close one of the remaining ________ days.
    - Hence, the number of possibilities equals ________.
    Solution:
    - The first bakery can close any day of the week. The second bakery can only close one of the remaining 6 days.
    - The third bakery can only close one of the remaining 5 days.
    - Finally, the last bakery can close one of the remaining 4 days.
    - Hence, the number of possibilities equals 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 = 840.
