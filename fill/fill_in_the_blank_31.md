    Question: We want to arrange on a shelf 4 distinct mathematics books, 6 distinct physics books, and 3 distinct chemistry books. In how many ways can we perform this arrangement if only the mathematics books must be grouped?
    Solution: There can be $0, 1, \ldots, 9$ books placed before the mathematics books. Therefore, there are ________ choices for the number of books placed before the mathematics books. Once this choice is made, there are ________ ways to arrange the mathematics books, and ________ ways to arrange the other books. Thus, there are a total of ________ different arrangements.

    - There can be 10 choices for the number of books placed before the mathematics books.
    - Once this choice is made, there are 4 ! ways to arrange the mathematics books.
    - There are 9 ! ways to arrange the other books.
    - Thus, there are a total of $10 \times 4! \times 9!$ different arrangements.
