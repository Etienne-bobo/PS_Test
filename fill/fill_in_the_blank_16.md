- A straight hand is constituted of ________ consecutive cards, and does not have the same color.
- To count the number of straight hands, we first count the number of hands constituted of ________ consecutive cards, regardless of color.
- Then, we subtract the number of ________ hands to get the final count.
- The number of hands constituted of 5 consecutive cards, regardless of color, is ________.
- Therefore, the total number of straight poker hands is ________.

Solution:
- A straight hand is constituted of 5 consecutive cards, and does not have the same color.
- To count the number of straight hands, we first count the number of hands constituted of 5 consecutive cards, regardless of color.
- Then, we subtract the number of straight flush hands to get the final count.
- The number of hands constituted of 5 consecutive cards, regardless of color, is 10 x 45 = 450.
- Therefore, the total number of straight poker hands is 450 - 40 = 410.
