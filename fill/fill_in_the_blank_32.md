Question: In this question we assume that $\mathbf{P}(A \cap B)=\mathbf{P}(A) \cdot \mathbf{P}(B)$, in other words that $A$ and $B$ are __________ from each other.
Solution:
- In this question we assume that $\mathbf{P}(A \cap B)=\mathbf{P}(A) \cdot \mathbf{P}(B)$, in other words that $A$ and $B$ are independent from each other.
- Let $C$ be another event. Show that

\begin{equation<em>}
\mathbf{P}(A \cap B \cap C)=\mathbf{P}(A)+\mathbf{P}(B)+\mathbf{P}(C)-\mathbf{P}(A \cup B)-\mathbf{P}(B \cup C)-\mathbf{P}(C \cup A)+\mathbf{P}(A \cup B \cup C) \tag{1}
\end{equation</em>}
